This application is an application that will be used at the vehicle service centre or car shop. This was inspired when a certain service centre was doing everything on paper and they had to write down the information every time they had to service a car. The problem with that is that there are many chances to make a mistake and record incorrect information and the papers can be easily lost without back up.
This new solution will solve all that. There will be more accuracy because most of the information will be pre loaded and not need to be entered in every time with the use of radio buttons and drop down menus etc. since this is digital, it is much more easier to back up the information in multiple locations to avoid loss. This will have functions to search for previous service documents in seconds instead of going through piles of paper.
